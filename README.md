### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing [PRBTest](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-test) and inherit from
it in your test contract. PRBTest comes with a pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/)
environment accessible via the `vm` property. If you would like to view the logs in the terminal output you can add the
`-vvv` flag and use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog).

This template comes with an example test contract [Foo.t.sol](./test/Foo.t.sol)

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.

### Format

Format the contracts:

```sh
$ forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

## Notes

1. Foundry uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage dependencies. For
   detailed instructions on working with dependencies, please refer to the
   [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/dependencies.html) in the book
2. You don't have to create a `.env` file, but filling in the environment variables may be useful when debugging and
   testing against a fork.
